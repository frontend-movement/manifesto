# Front-End Movement Manifesto

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/frontend-movement/manifesto)](https://github.com/frontend-movement/manifesto/blob/master/LICENSE)

The **Front-End Movement** is a group of developers involved in spreading a constructive culture about **Front-End Development**.

We firmly believe that the Front-End Development is an _essential_ part of the creation of any technological product or service that requires human interaction.

## Principles

- The Front-End part of a software development process _is not less important_ than the other parts
- Being a Front-End Developer requires _more vertical than horizontal knowledge_ in the spectrum of software development – we do not believe in _full-stack_ development

## How To Sign

The main purpose of this movement is to build a community of people who share our Principles. If you find this Manifesto useful for you and/or your work please share it with your network. **Sharing is how we would like people to sign this document.**
