# Front-End Movement Manifesto

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/frontend-movement/manifesto)](https://github.com/frontend-movement/manifesto/blob/master/LICENSE)

The **Front-End Movement** is a group of developers involved in spreading a constructive culture about **Front-End Development**.

We firmly believe that the Front-End Development is an _essential_ part of the creation of any technological product or service that requires human interaction.

## Principles

- **The front-end part of a software development cycle _is not less important_ than the other parts**
- **Being a Front-End Developer requires _more vertical than horizontal knowledge_ in the spectrum of software development – we do not believe in _full-stack_ development**
- **No one should be discriminated in a work environment because he or she deals with Front-End Development – being a Frontender _is not less worthy_ than having other roles**

## How To Sign

The main purpose of this movement is to build a community of people who share our Principles. If you find this Manifesto useful for you and/or your work please share it with your network. **Sharing is how we would like people to sign this document.**
